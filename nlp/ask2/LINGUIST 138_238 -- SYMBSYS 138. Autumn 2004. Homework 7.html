<ol>
<p>
This homework has two parts
</p><p>
</p><li> <b>Part 1: Error Analysis on the AskMSR system:</b>
Go to beta.search.msn.com.  Choose 10 questions
from the readings.  Type them into both this new microsoft question answering
system and google.  Write up a short (1-2page) analysis of all the errors
(for example, which kinds of questions could neither system answer; which kinds
of questions did one work better on;  was there a type of question that
could be answered from google just from the "summaries" that google returned
without reading the pages, etc etc).
<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>Part 2: Simplified Question-Answerer:</b>
You are going to implement the AskMSR approach to web-based question-answering
in a small way.  Although the assignment has many small functions you need
to implement, it's easier than it looks, since each function is very simple, mainly requiring you to write a  few
regular expression substitution patterns for each step.  
<ol>

<p>
</p><li>
In order to do this, you'll need to be able to run code that automatically
searches Google.   We have given you code that does this for you!
But only in Java and Perl. If you can't program in either of these languages,
you can still just run the programs from the command line without modifying them.

</li><li>
<p>
First, you'll need to get a Google key.  Go to <a href="http://api.google.com/">api.google.com</a>
and sign up for a key. (It's under <b>Create a Google Account</b>).
<b>PLEASE DO THIS BEFORE THANKSGIVING</b>.

</p></li><li>
<p>
Now you need to make sure you can run the programs to search Google for you.  
We've copied some relevant scripts for doing this in Java and in Perl onto the AFS directory
for the class.  It looks like these will currently only work from the Elaine file server
in Sweet Hall, so you'll need to  ssh into elaine.stanford.edu to run these.
(Although if you have Soap or other web services running on other machines
feel free to try it from those).
We've given you sample scripts that take a Google query and return 10 documents.
Both scripts require you to enter the KEY that you get from Google
when you register at Google.  

</p><p>
For perl, you can use the program /afs/ir/class/linguist238/googly.pl,
which we stole from the book Google Hacks.  You first modify it by
putting your key here in this line:
</p><pre>my $google_key='insert key here';
</pre>

You then run it as follows:

<pre>/afs/ir/class/linguist238/googly.pl <query>
</query></pre>

<p>
It will print out the top 10 results from Google for your query,
together with their titles, and the "snippet", the short text that Google returns.
Of course, you may want to to modify this code as you work on the homework.

</p><p>
For java, you can do the following from the command line (where KEY is your google key, and Foo is your query string):

</p><pre>java -cp /afs/ir/class/linguist238/googleapi.jar com.google.soap.search.GoogleAPIDemo KEY search Foo
</pre>

<p>
The sample java code  is in /afs/ir/class/linguist238/GoogleAPIDemo.java  
More information on the Google java class is in /afs/ir/class/linguist238/googleapi.

</p><p>
</p></li><li>
OK, once you've made sure that you can search Google, you are ready to do the homework.

<p>
Here's the steps for building a simplified AskMSR-style question answering.
</p><ol>
<li> <b>Query Reformulation:</b>
<p>
Given a question, rewrite the question in various ways to generate a number
of search strings that are likely to match an answer.  For example,
given:

</p><pre>Where is the Louvre located?
</pre>

you might generate strings like the following:

<pre>the Louvre is located
the is Louvre located
the Louvre located is
</pre>

by writing some simple rules.  For example, one rule might be:
<pre>If the query begins with the word "where", remove that word
and try moving the next word everywhere else in the query.
</pre>
You could even (but don't have to) have more complicated rules, such as 
<pre>In addition, if the query begins with the word "where"
and doesn't end in "located", add the word "located".
(or if it does end in "located", replace "located" with "near" or "in)
</pre>

producing more strings like the following:
<pre>the Louvre is in
the Louvre is near
</pre>


<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Search Google:</b>
Now take the resulting queries and search google with them using your java or perl scripts
(or modifications of them). You might need to use "+" to make sure it searches
for the function words.  Of course, some of these
queries might return nothing! (Like "the is Louvre located").
That's ok, all you care about is the ones that work.

<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Text Normalization:</b>
Take the "snippets" (page summaries) that Google returns for each query.
You'll need to do some simple text normalization on them to get rid of the html
font commands and whatnot, and also to move periods and commas and etc
away from words.

<p>
</p></li><li> <b>N-gram mining:</b>
Now take the text-normalized "snippets" (page summaries).
From these snippets, compute unigrams, bigrams and trigrams,
and compute a count for each of these of <b>how many snippets they occur in</b>.
Only count the N-gram once per snippet.
For example, if the bigram "San Francisco" occurs  in 4 snippet, twice in each,
count it as 4, not 8.

<p>
</p></li><li> <b>N-gram filtering/reweighting:</b>
You are going to filter the N-grams to rule out those that are not likely to be good answers
to the query.  You will do this in two parts. First,
you will write some "query-type-identification" rules.
Your rules should look at the query
and assign it a question type like <i>who-question</i>, <i>where-question</i>,
<i>when-question</i>, <i>how-many-question</i>, or <i>what-question</i>.
It's ok if these rules are very very simple, i.e. just checking if the first word is <i>where</i> or such.
Next, given that you know the "query-type" of your question,
you should write one or two rules for each query-type which filter out 
unlikely N-grams,  or reweight them.  For example, if your query-type is "when-question",
you might have a rule that says "increase the score of any N-gram that has a date
in it", or "lower the score of any N-gram that doesn't have a number in it".
Or for <i>who-questions</i>, you might increase the score of any N-gram that has
a word starting with a capital letter...

<p>
</p></li><li> <b>N-gram Tiling:</b>
This final step assembles longer answers from overlapping smaller
answer fragments.  For example, "A B C" and "B C D" is tiled into "A B C D".
Use a simple tiling algorithm like the one in AskMSR. 
You can simplify it to only return a single answer (they returned a whole string of answers).
A simplified description of their algorithm, following their explanation, is
roughly as follows: start greedily from the
best-scoring candidate, and check all subsequent candiates (up to a certain cutoff)
to see if they can be tiled with the current candidate answer.  If so,
the higher scoring candidate is replaced with the longer tiled n-gram, and the lower scoring
candidate is removed.  The algorithm stops when no n-grams can be further tiled
with the best-scoring candidate.  Then return the best-scoring candidate.

<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>Evaluation:</b>
Now that you have a question answering algorithm, run it on 5 questions, including
the following 4, plus 1 more that you select
(there are other sample questions from the TREC-9 competition <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/wilsong/IR/trec9.html">here</a>.)
<ol>
<li>Where is Belize located?
</li><li>Where is the Valley of the Kings?
</li><li>Who is William Wordsworth?
</li><li>When was Babe Ruth born?
</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>
Evaluate how many of your questions returned the right answer (as a percentage out of 5).
Use yourself as the "expert labeler" to decide what the write answer should have been.
Discuss the performance of your system; for example, what kinds of knowledge would
you have needed to do better on the questions that your system failed on?
</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>Turn in your answer to problem 1, your code, the results of your code running on the 5 questions,
details of the steps of your algorithm on at least 1 of the questions, and
your error analysis of your system's performance.
</li></ol>
