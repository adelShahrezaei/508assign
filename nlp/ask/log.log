'Paris' () is the capital and most populous city in France, with an administrative-
limits area of and an official population of 2,206,488 (2015)."Paris perd ses
habitants, la faute à la démographie et aux… meublés touristiques pour la
Ville." Le Parisien, 28 December 2017 The city is a commune and department, and
the heart of the Île-de-France region (colloquially known as the 'Paris
Region'), whose 2016 population of 12,142,802 represented roughly 18 percent of
the population of France. Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's
major centres of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts. The Paris
Region had a GDP of €681 billion (US$850 billion) in 2016, accounting for 31
percent of the GDP of France. According to official estimates, in 2013-14 the
Paris Region had the third-highest GDP in the world and the largest regional GDP
in the EU.

The City of Paris's administrative limits form an East-West oval centred on
the island at its historical heart, the Île de la Cité; this island is near
the top of an arc of the river Seine that divides the city into southern Rive
Gauche (Left Bank) and northern Rive Droite regions. Paris is the core of a
built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the
agglomération Parisienne, and statistically as a [[unité urbaine]] (a measure
of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's 2013 population of 10,601,122 made
it the largest urban area in the European Union. City-influenced commuter
activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical ''aire urbaine'' de
Paris (a measure of metropolitan area), that had a 2013 population of
12,405,426, a number one-fifth the population of France, the largest
metropolitan area in the Eurozone.

The city is a major rail, highway, and air-transport hub served by two
international airports: Paris-Charles de Gaulle (the second busiest airport in
Europe after London Heathrow Airport with 63.8 million passengers in 2014) and
Paris-Orly. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves
5.23 million passengers daily, and is the second busiest metro system in Europe
after Moscow Metro. Paris's Gare du Nord is one of the ten busiest railway
stations in the world, with 262 million passengers in 2015.

Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the
Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world in 2016, with 7.4 million
visitors.The Art Newspaper Visitor Figures 2016, 29 March 2016 The Musée d'Orsay
and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist
art, and the Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest
collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe. The historical district
along the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site.
Popular landmarks in the centre of the city include the Cathedral of Notre Dame
de Paris and The Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, both on the Île de la
Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889;
the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of
1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées, and the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur
on the hill of Montmartre. Paris received 23 million visitors in 2017,[https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/tourisme-

The association football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club
Stade Français are based in Paris. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for
the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring
commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis
tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. Paris hosted the Olympic Games in
1900, 1924 and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World
Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and the 1960, 1984, and 2016 UEFA European
Championships were also held in the city, and every July, the Tour de France
bicycle race finishes there.

}} The 'Eiffel Tower' ( ; ) is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars
in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company
designed and built the tower.

Constructed from 1887–89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was
initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for
its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the
most recognisable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited
paid monument in the world; 6.91&nbsp;million people ascended it in 2015.

The tower is tall, about the same height as an 81- building, and the tallest
structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring on each side. During its
construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the
tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the
Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of
a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the
Chrysler Building by . Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second
tallest structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.

The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and
second levels. The top level's upper platform is above the ground – the highest
observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be
purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels.
The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the
climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the
top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.

'Tehran' (; ) is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province. With a population of
around 8.8 million in the city and 15 million in the larger metropolitan area of
Greater Tehran, Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western Asia,See
[[List of metropolitan areas in Asia]]. and has the second-largest metropolitan
area in the Middle East. It is ranked 29th in the world by the population of its
metropolitan area.

In the Classical era, part of the territory of present-day Tehran was occupied
by Rhages, a prominent Median city. It was subject to destruction through the
medieval Arab, Turkic, and Mongol invasions. Its modern-day inheritor remains as
an urban area absorbed into the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran.

Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the
Qajar dynasty in 1796, in order to remain within close reach of Iran's
territories in the Caucasus, before being separated from Iran as a result of the
Russo-Iranian Wars, and to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling
Iranian dynasties. The capital has been moved several times throughout the
history, and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Iran. Large scale demolition
and rebuilding began in the 1920s, and Tehran has been a destination for mass
migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century.

Tehran is home to many historical collections, including the royal complexes of
Golestan, Sa'dabad, and Niavaran, where the two last dynasties of the former
Imperial State of Iran were seated. Tehran's most famous landmarks include the
Azadi Tower, a memorial built under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah of the
Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the 2,500th year of the foundation of the
Imperial State of Iran, and the Milad Tower, the world's sixth-tallest self-
supporting tower which was completed in 2007. The Tabiat Bridge, a newly-built
landmark, was completed in 2014.

The majority of the population of Tehran are Persian-speaking people, and
roughly 99% of the population understand and speak Persian, but there are large
populations of other ethno-linguistic groups who live in Tehran and speak
Persian as a second language.

Tehran is served by the international airports of Mehrabad and Khomeini, a
central railway station, the rapid transit system of Tehran Metro, a bus rapid
transit system, trolleybuses, and a large network of highways.

There have been plans to relocate Iran's capital from Tehran to another area,
due mainly to air pollution and the city's exposure to earthquakes. To date, no
definitive plans have been approved. A 2016 survey of 230 cities by consultant
Mercer ranked Tehran 203rd for quality of life. According to the Global
Destinations Cities Index in 2016, Tehran is among the top ten fastest growing
destinations.

York City Department of Environmental Protection. Accessed February 9, 2017.
"These impervious surfaces cover approximately 72% of New York City’s 305 square
miles in land area and generate a significant amount of stormwater." New York
City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located
at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New
York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban
landmass and one of the world's most populous megacities, with an estimated
20.3&nbsp;million people in its 2017 Metropolitan Statistical Area and
23.7&nbsp;million residents in its Combined Statistical Area. A global power
city, New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media
capital of the world, and exerts a significant impact upon commerce,
entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, and sports.
The city's fast pace defines the term [[wikt:New York minute|New York minute]].
Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[http://visit.un.org/content/plan-your-

you enter an international territory. This 18-acre site does not belong to just
one country, but to all countries that have joined the Organization; currently,
the United Nations has 193 Member States." New York is an important center for
international diplomacy.

Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists
of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of the State of New York.
The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island –
were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area
constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As
many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically
diverse city in the world. New York City is home to more than 3.2 million
residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population of
any city in the world. In 2013, the tri-state New York Metropolitan Statistical
Area (MSA) produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly
US$1.4&nbsp;trillion. If greater New York City were a sovereign state, it would
have the 12th highest GDP in the world.

New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the
Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in
1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were
renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his
brother, the Duke of York. New York served as the capital of the United States
from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The
Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by
ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a world symbol of the
United States and its ideals of liberty and peace. In the 21st century, New York
has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social
tolerance, and environmental sustainability, and as a symbol of freedom and
cultural diversity.

Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, and the city
received a record 62.8 million tourists in 2017, hosting three of the world's
ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. Several sources have ranked New
York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconic as the
world's "heart" and its "Crossroads", is the brightly illuminated hub of the
Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,
and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of
the city's bridges, skyscrapers,[http://skyscrapercenter.com/city/new-york-city

Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been
called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center
of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by
total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Manhattan's
real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Manhattan's
Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the
Western Hemisphere, with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the

'Google LLC' is an American multinational technology company that specializes in
Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising
technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. Google was
founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at
Stanford University, California. Together, they own about 14 percent of its
shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through
supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on
September 4, 1998. An Initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19,
2004, and Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View, California,
nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize
its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google, Alphabet's
leading subsidiary, will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's
Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructure, Sundar Pichai was
appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet.

The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of
products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine
(Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google
Docs, Sheets, and Slides), email (Gmail/Inbox), scheduling and time management
(Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), social networking (Google+),
instant messaging and video chat (Google Allo/Duo/Hangouts), language
translation (Google Translate), mapping and turn-by-turn navigation (Google
Maps/Waze/Earth/Street View), video sharing (YouTube), note-taking (Google
Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the
development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web
browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome
browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it
partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Nexus
devices, and in October 2016, it released multiple hardware products (including
the Google Pixel smartphone, Home smart speaker, Wifi mesh wireless router, and
Daydream View virtual reality headset). The new hardware chief, Rick Osterloh,
stated: "a lot of the innovation that we want to do now ends up requiring
controlling the end-to-end user experience". Google has also experimented with
becoming an Internet carrier. In February 2010, it announced Google Fiber, a fiber-
optic infrastructure that was installed in Kansas City; in April 2015, it
launched Project Fi in the United States, combining Wi-Fi and cellular networks
from different providers; and in 2016, it announced the Google Station
initiative to make public Wi-Fi available around the world, with initial
deployment in India.

Alexa, a company that monitors commercial web traffic, lists Google.com as the
most visited website in the world. Several other Google services also figure
in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube and Blogger. Google is
the most valuable brand in the world as of 2017, but has received significant
criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust,
censorship, and search neutrality. Google's mission statement, from the
outset, was "to organize the world's information and make it universally
accessible and useful", and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil". In
October 2015, the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct
by the phrase "Do the right thing", while the original one was retained in the
code of conduct of Google.
